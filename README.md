This Kata was modified by Antonio LÃ³pez, to implement the new products (Conjured) for Gilded Rose.

## How to use this Kata

It is needed to clone this repository, open the Solution (csharp.sln) in visual studio.
The solution includes the project csharp.csproj and for running it it's needed to have installed Framework 4.5.2.
After checking the requirements, just run the project (test files are ready to be read) and the results will be displayed in the console for each product.
